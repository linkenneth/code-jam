'''
ideas:
- constraints: build a list of radial / circular constraints.
continually select points which reduces the possible area by half
- issues: how to calculate possible areas? how to determine
dart points to throw at? what if you don't have single contiguous
area to easily calculate a point by which to reduce search space?
- optimizations: select the 4 quarter-points on axis in very
first round of darts to quickly determine hemisphere
